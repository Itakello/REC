# Visual Grounding Project Outline

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the methodology and steps for a visual grounding project, which aims to link linguistic descriptions (referring expressions) to specific objects in images. The project utilizes the RefCOCOg dataset and employs a combination of pre-trained models and custom components to achieve accurate visual grounding.

## 2. Baseline Evaluation

### 2.1 YOLO Model Selection

**Objective**: Determine the best-performing YOLO model for our dataset.

**Method**:
- Evaluate multiple YOLO versions (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv8) on the RefCOCOg dataset.
- For each image, compare YOLO-generated bounding boxes with ground truth.
- Calculate Intersection over Union (IoU) for each prediction.
- Determine success rate at various IoU thresholds.

**Outcome**: 
- Select the YOLO model with the highest success rate.
- Identify the optimal IoU threshold balancing accuracy and leniency.

### 2.2 Concurrent Evaluation of Visual Highlighting and Sentence Encoding

**Objective**: Determine the most effective combination of visual highlighting method and sentence encoding approach to minimize the difference between visual and textual representations.

**Visual Highlighting Methods**:
1. Red Circle: Draw a red circle around the object of interest.
2. Red Rectangle: Draw a red rectangle around the object of interest.
3. Blur: Blur the background while keeping the object of interest in focus.
4. Crop: Crop the image to show only the object of interest and its immediate surroundings.
5. Blackout: Blacken the rest of the image, leaving only the object of interest visible.

**Sentence Encoding Methods**:
1. Original Sentences: Use all provided referring expressions separately.
2. Comprehensive Sentence: Use the LLM-generated comprehensive description.
3. Combined Approach: Use both original and comprehensive sentences.

**Evaluation Process**:

For each combination of visual highlighting method and sentence encoding approach:
1. Apply the YOLO model to detect objects in the image.
2. Use the visual highlighting method on the detected objects.
3. Encode the sentences using the chosen method.
4. Use CLIP to compute the similarity between the highlighted image regions and the sentence encodings.
5. Rank the highlighted regions based on their similarity to the sentence encodings.
6. Calculate evaluation metrics (see below).

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): Measures the average reciprocal of the rank of the correct object.
- Recall@K: The proportion of times the correct object is within the top K ranked candidates.
- Average Similarity Score: The mean similarity score between the correct object and its corresponding sentence encoding.

**Outcome**: 
- Identify the combination of visual highlighting method and sentence encoding approach that yields the highest performance across the evaluation metrics.
- This optimal combination will provide the best initial ranking for the final classification method.

## 3. Candidate Selection for Classification

**Objective**: Determine the optimal number of candidates (K) to provide to the classification model.

**Method**:
1. Using the best visual highlighting and sentence encoding methods from step 2.2:
2. For each image, rank YOLO-generated candidates by their similarity to the encoded sentences.
3. Vary K from 1 to a maximum value (e.g., 10 or 20).
4. For each K, calculate:
   - Recall@K: Whether the correct object is within the top K candidates (1 if true, 0 if false).
5. For each sample, calculate:
   - Reciprocal Rank: The reciprocal of the rank of the correct object.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Average Recall@K: The mean of Recall@K across all samples, for each K.
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): The average of the Reciprocal Ranks across all samples.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Average Recall@K vs. K: Plot this relationship to find the "elbow point" where increasing K yields diminishing returns.
- MRR: This metric provides insight into the overall ranking quality across all samples.
- Computational Efficiency: Consider the trade-off between higher K and increased processing time.
- Model Complexity: Balance between providing enough candidates for the model to learn from and avoiding overwhelming it with too many options.

## 4. Final Classification Model

**Objective**: Train a model to select the correct object from the top K candidates.

**Input**:
- Raw image embedding (optional, to be determined)
- Encoded referring expressions (using the best sentence encoding method)
- Embeddings of top K candidates, each processed with the best visual highlighting method

**Output**:
Index of the candidate that best matches the referring expressions.

**Proposed Model Architectures**:
1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
2. Transformer-based model
3. Graph Neural Network (GNN)

**Training Strategy**:
- Use the selected YOLO model for generating candidates.
- Apply the best visual highlighting method to the K candidates.
- Use the best sentence encoding approach for the referring expressions.
- Experiment with including/excluding the raw image embedding to determine its impact on performance.
- Provide the top K candidates as determined in step 3.
- Train the model to predict the index of the correct candidate.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct selections (i.e., the model chooses the correct candidate).
- Top-N Accuracy: Percentage of times the correct candidate is in the model's top N predictions, for various values of N < K.

## 5. Conclusion

This project outline provides a structured approach to developing a visual grounding system. By systematically evaluating each component and making data-driven decisions, we aim to create a robust and accurate model for linking linguistic descriptions to visual objects. The concurrent evaluation of visual highlighting methods and sentence encoding approaches allows for a more holistic optimization of the system's initial ranking capabilities. This approach recognizes the interdependence of these components and aims to find the most synergistic combination, providing a strong foundation for the subsequent classification model.

## 6. Overall Assessment

The proposed approach for this visual grounding project is well-structured and methodical. Here are some key strengths and considerations:

1. **Comprehensive Baseline**: The project starts with a solid baseline evaluation, considering multiple factors (YOLO model, IoU threshold, visual highlighting method, and sentence encoding) that influence performance.

2. **Concurrent Evaluation**: The decision to evaluate visual highlighting methods and sentence encoding approaches concurrently is excellent. This recognizes the interdependence of these components and will likely lead to finding more optimal combinations.

3. **Visual Highlighting Variety**: The range of visual highlighting methods (red circle, red rectangle, blur, crop, blackout) provides a good spectrum of approaches, from minimal intervention (circle/rectangle) to more drastic image modifications (crop/blackout).

4. **Iterative Refinement**: The project structure allows for iterative improvement at each stage, building upon the results of previous evaluations.

5. **Balance of Accuracy and Efficiency**: The project considers both performance accuracy and computational efficiency, which is crucial for real-world applications.

6. **Flexibility**: The outlined approach is flexible enough to accommodate different architectures and techniques in the final classification model.
